# Bridge monitoring using six-component ground motion measurements

This repository contains six-component (6C) seismic recordings from a bridge monitoring experiment conducted as part of the GIOTTO Project. We propose a novel approach for real-time, continuous seismic structural health monitoring. Our system uses collocated triaxial seismometers and rotational sensors. In a validation experiment, we simulate damage through controlled loading and prestressing with weight-drop sources generating elastic waves on a concrete bridge model. This study demonstrates the effectiveness and high spatiotemporal resolution of the proposed amplitude-ratio method using 6C data for monitoring structural changes.
